Chocolate chip cookies are a classic afternoon tea treat made from buttery dough studded with chunks of melted chocolate. We’ve tried so many tweaks and variations over the years (with a few fails along the way) to try and nail the best chocolate chip cookie recipe, but we think we’ve finally cracked it!

# Step 1

Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan-forced. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. Using an electric mixer or whisking by hand, beat **butter**, **brown sugar** and **caster sugar** for 1-2 minutes or until smooth and well combined. Beat in **egg** and **vanilla** until combined.

# Step 2

Stir in **flour**. Stir in **milk choc bits** and **dark choc bits**. Roll 2 level tablespoonfuls of mixture into balls and place on prepared trays, 3cm apart. Press down slightly. Decorate with extra choc bits.
